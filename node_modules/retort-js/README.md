Intuitive prompt chaining in Javascript. Designed for production.

## Usage

```js
let $ = new Conversation();

$.system`You are a 'Retorter', an AI that responds in a quick & witty manner.`;

await $.user.input();

await $.assistant.generation();
```

Refer to the [examples](#examples) section below for more details.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install via NPM, run:

```sh
npm i retort-js
```

### Give Retort a try

The quickest way to try Retort is in our playground:

This will open a development project with an example script you can modify, and a UI where you can run your script and see the output of each message in the conversation. You will need to add your own OpenAI API key.

### How to run your first Retort script

#### API key setup

> [!NOTE]
> Currently only setup to use with OpenAI's API.

Add your OpenAI API key to the following environment variable:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>
```

#### Setup 'retort' directory

Create a `retort` directory within your project. This will be the root directory for all your retort scripts.

#### Create first file

Create a new `example.rt.js` file and copy and paste the following code:

```js
import { RetortConversation } from "retort-js";

let $ = new RetortConversation();

$.system`You are 'Retorter', an AI that responds in a quick & witty manner.`;

await $.user.input();

await $.assistant.generation();
```

#### Run the script

You can see the output of the conversation directly in your console by running the following command:

```sh
node retort/example.rt.js
```

This will show you each message in the conversation so you can easily see what happpen at each step of the conversation.

#### What's going on here?

We are defining a new conversation, passing a simple instruction to the system and then waiting for the user to input their message before finally awaiting the response from the LLM.

##### The $

This is a RetortConversation. It keeps track of all the messages in a script and exposes methods for creating a message for each role type (system, user and assistant), and allows you to build a chain of prompts.

These can be called with a string or with a tagged template literal:

```js
// valid
$.system("Write a haiku about LLMs (Large Language Models).");

// also valid
$.system`Write a haiku about LLMs (Large Language Models).`;
```

In your terminal you should see the initial system message. You can now enter your own message for the assistant to reply to. Once you've entered your message the `assistant.generation()` function will interface with the OpenAI API and return the response.

You can now see exactly what happened each step of the way.

The [RetortConversation](#retortconversation-properties) object also exposes various settings such as the model, temperature and topP.

## retort()

The retort function creates a Retort object. This object represents a conversation that can be run. The function takes a chatFunction as an argument, which is a function that defines the conversation (ie, your script).

The chatFunction takes a RetortConversation ($) as an argument. It can also take any number of additional arguments but we don't need those for this example.

The retort function then returns a Retort object that includes a unique ID, a run function, and a retortType property. You can then call this run function on the exported Retort object wherever you're using it in your codebase. It allows you to run the file as either a script or a module.

# Examples

A basic script that accepts user input:

```js
module.exports = require("retort-js").retort(async ($) => {
  $.system`You are 'Retorter', an AI that responds in a quick & witty manner.`;

  await $.user.input();

  await $.assistant.generation();
});
```

The script will wait for your input into the console before calling the assistant.generation() function.

Passing parameters to a conversation:

```js
module.exports = require("retort-js").retort(async ($, { age }) => {
  $.user`A birthday message for someone ${age} years old`;

  await $.assistant.generation();
});
```

---

A script that imports and runs another script:

```js
// script.rt.cjs
module.exports = require("retort-js").retort(async ($) => {
  const imported = await $.run(require("./example-2.rt.js"));

  // use the imported conversation here
});

// script.rt.mjs
import { RetortConversation } from "retort-js";
import scriptExample from "./script-example.rt.mjs";



await $.run(scriptExample);

// continue your conversation:

await $.user.input();

await $.assistant.generation();
```

---

If you're using ESM:

```js
import { retort } from "retort-js";

const retorter = retort(async ($) => {
  $.system`You are 'Retorter', an AI that responds in a quick & witty manner.`;

  await $.user.input();

  await $.assistant.generation();
});

retorter._run(); // Run the conversation
```
